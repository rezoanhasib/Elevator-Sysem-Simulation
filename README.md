# Elevator-Sysem-Simulation
The purpose of this assignment is to perform simulation of a building's elevator system that processes passenger requests. 
The program takes input parameters to the simulation representing the number of floors in the building, the number of elevators,
the simulation length in time units, and the percent chance that a passenger will place a new elevator request during each time unit.
The task of this program is to calculate the average waiting time for passenger requests.
